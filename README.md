# Life Checklist App

Welcome to the **Life Checklist App**! This is a simple and fun checklist app where you can track and celebrate achieving your life goals. It allows you to select tasks from a list of goals, and once youâ€™ve completed them all, youâ€™ll be greeted with a congratulatory message and confetti!

## Features:
- **Goal Selection:** A checklist of life goals that you can mark as completed by clicking the checkbox on each card.
- **Progressive Experience:** As you select goals, a **floating scroll-to-top button** appears when you scroll down.
- **Confetti Celebration:** When all the goals are selected, the app will show a **confetti animation** and a **"All Goals Achieved!"** message to congratulate you.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: Frontend framework to build the interactive UI.
- **Ant Design**: UI components like Cards, Checkboxes, Buttons, and Typography.
- **React Confetti**: Used to display confetti when all goals are achieved.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to enhance the look and feel of the app.

### How it works:

1. **Goal List**: The app displays a list of life goals such as "Learn to Ride a Bicycle", "Visit Disneyland", "Catch a Firefly", and more. These are presented as cards for a clean and interactive layout.
2. **Checkbox Interaction**: Each goal has a checkbox. When you complete a goal, simply click the checkbox, and it will be marked as done. The progress bar updates accordingly.
3. **Scroll to Top Button**: As you scroll down the page, a floating button will appear on the right side of the screen. You can click this button to scroll back to the top of the page for easier navigation.
4. **Completion Celebration**: When all the goals are marked as complete, the app will display a fun confetti animation and a celebratory message: "ðŸŽ‰ All Goals Achieved! ðŸŽ‰". This adds an element of joy and accomplishment to your journey.


### Future Enhancements:

- **Add a Timer/Deadline**: Allow users to set deadlines or time frames for completing their goals. This can add a sense of urgency and help users prioritize tasks.
- **Track Progress**: Display progress in percentages, showing how many goals have been completed versus the total number of goals. This visual feedback can motivate users.
- **Add User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and save their progress across different sessions. Users can come back later to track their achievements without losing data.
- **Goal Categories**: Introduce categories like "Career", "Personal", "Adventure", etc. This way, users can focus on specific types of goals at any given time.
- **Sharing Options**: Enable users to share their achievements and progress on social media platforms to inspire others.
- **Goal Priority**: Add a feature to allow users to mark certain goals as high priority and display them more prominently.
- **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode to provide an alternative theme for users who prefer a darker interface.
